### 1.基本数据类型互相转换
`T(value)`

```go
var a int = 10
var b float = float(a)
var c int64 = int64(a)

```

### 2. 字符串连接


```go
var str string = "hello" + "world"
```

### 3. for 循环有三种形式 （for-range循环后面讨论）


**第一种：**

完整版for循环：`for 循环变量初始化，循环条件，循环变量迭代 { }`


```go
for var i int = 0 ； i <= 10 ; i++ {
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

**第二种：**

优化版for循环： `for 循环条件 { }`

```go
i := 10
for i <= 100 {
  fmt.Println("Hello World!")
  i++
}
```

**第三种循环：**

死循环版for循环： `for { }` or `for ;; {}`

这种死循环通常配合 `break` 语句使用。

### 4. 自增、自减只能单独使用且加号减号都只能在后面



```go
i++ // right
i-- // right

--i // false
++i // false

//right
for i := 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ {

}


//false ,自增自减只能作为单独的语句使用。
if i++ {

}

```

### 2.1 方法集



A type may have a *method set* associated with it. The method set of an [interface type](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Interface_types) is its interface. The method set of any other type `T` consists of all [methods](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Method_declarations) declared with receiver type `T`. The method set of the corresponding [pointer type](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Pointer_types) `*T` is the set of all methods declared with receiver `*T` or `T` (that is, it also contains the method set of `T`). Further rules apply to structs containing embedded fields, as described in the section on [struct types](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Struct_types). Any other type has an empty method set. In a method set, each method must have a [unique](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Uniqueness_of_identifiers) non-[blank](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Blank_identifier) [method name](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#MethodName).

The method set of a type determines the interfaces that the type [implements](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Interface_types) and the methods that can be [called](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Calls) using a receiver of that type.

### 2.2 布尔类型 - 数据类型



A *boolean type* represents the set of Boolean truth values denoted by the predeclared constants `true` and `false`. The predeclared boolean type is `bool`; it is a [defined type](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_definitions).



### 2.3. 数值型（ Numeric Types）-数据类型



**[The Go Programming Language -Numeric_types](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Numeric_types)**

```go
// A numeric type represents sets of integer or floating-point values. 
// The predeclared architecture-independent numeric types are:

uint8       the set of all unsigned  8-bit integers (0 to 255)
uint16      the set of all unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
uint32      the set of all unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
uint64      the set of all unsigned 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)

int8        the set of all signed  8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
int16       the set of all signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
int32       the set of all signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64       the set of all signed 64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

float32     the set of all IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers
float64     the set of all IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers

complex64   the set of all complex numbers with float32 real and imaginary parts
complex128  the set of all complex numbers with float64 real and imaginary parts

byte        alias for uint8
rune        alias for int32
//The value of an n-bit integer is n bits wide and represented using two's complement arithmetic.

//There is also a set of predeclared numeric types with implementation-specific sizes:

uint     either 32 or 64 bits
int      same size as uint
uintptr  an unsigned integer large enough to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value
//To avoid portability issues all numeric types are defined types and thus distinct except byte, which is an alias for uint8, and rune, which is an alias for int32. Explicit conversions are required when different numeric types are mixed in an expression or assignment. For instance, int32 and int are not the same type even though they may have the same size on a particular architecture.
```

### 2.4. 字符型（String Types）-数据类型



A *string type* represents the set of string values. A string value is a (possibly empty) sequence of bytes. The number of bytes is called the length of the string and is never negative. Strings are immutable: once created, it is impossible to change the contents of a string. The predeclared string type is `string`; it is a [defined type](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_definitions).

The length of a string `s` can be discovered using the built-in function [`len`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Length_and_capacity). The length is a compile-time constant if the string is a constant. A string's bytes can be accessed by integer [indices](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Index_expressions) 0 through `len(s)-1`. It is illegal to take the address of such an element; if `s[i]` is the `i`'th byte of a string, `&s[i]` is invalid.

### 2.5. 数组（Array Types）-数据类型



An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type, called the element type. The number of elements is called the length of the array and is never negative.

```go
ArrayType   = "[" ArrayLength "]" ElementType .
ArrayLength = Expression .
ElementType = Type .
```

The length is part of the array's type; it must evaluate to a non-negative [constant](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Constants) [representable](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Representability) by a value of type `int`. The length of array `a` can be discovered using the built-in function [`len`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Length_and_capacity). The elements can be addressed by integer [indices](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Index_expressions) 0 through `len(a)-1`. Array types are always one-dimensional but may be composed to form multi-dimensional types.

```go
[32]byte
[2*N] struct { x, y int32 }
[1000]*float64
[3][5]int
[2][2][2]float64  // same as [2]([2]([2]float64))
```

### 2.6. 切片-数据类型

A slice is a descriptor for a contiguous segment of an *underlying array* and provides access to a numbered sequence of elements from that array. A slice type denotes the set of all slices of arrays of its element type. The number of elements is called the length of the slice and is never negative. The value of an uninitialized slice is `nil`.

```go
SliceType = "[" "]" ElementType .	
```

The length of a slice `s` can be discovered by the built-in function [`len`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Length_and_capacity); unlike with arrays it may change during execution. The elements can be addressed by integer [indices](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Index_expressions) 0 through `len(s)-1`. The slice index of a given element may be less than the index of the same element in the underlying array.

A slice, once initialized, is always associated with an underlying array that holds its elements. A slice therefore shares storage with its array and with other slices of the same array; by contrast, distinct arrays always represent distinct storage.

The array underlying a slice may extend past the end of the slice. The *capacity* is a measure of that extent: it is the sum of the length of the slice and the length of the array beyond the slice; a slice of length up to that capacity can be created by [*slicing*](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Slice_expressions) a new one from the original slice. The capacity of a slice `a` can be discovered using the built-in function [`cap(a)`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Length_and_capacity).

A new, initialized slice value for a given element type `T` is made using the built-in function [`make`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Making_slices_maps_and_channels), which takes a slice type and parameters specifying the length and optionally the capacity. A slice created with `make` always allocates a new, hidden array to which the returned slice value refers. That is, executing

```go
make([]T, length, capacity)
```

produces the same slice as allocating an array and [slicing](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Slice_expressions) it, so these two expressions are equivalent:

```go
make([]int, 50, 100)
new([100]int)[0:50]
```

Like arrays, slices are always one-dimensional but may be composed to construct higher-dimensional objects. With arrays of arrays, the inner arrays are, by construction, always the same length; however with slices of slices (or arrays of slices), the inner lengths may vary dynamically. Moreover, the inner slices must be initialized individually.

### 2.7.结构体-数据类型

A struct is a sequence of named elements, called fields, each of which has a name and a type. Field names may be specified explicitly (IdentifierList) or implicitly (EmbeddedField). Within a struct, non-[blank](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Blank_identifier) field names must be [unique](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Uniqueness_of_identifiers).

```go
StructType    = "struct" "{" { FieldDecl ";" } "}" .
FieldDecl     = (IdentifierList Type | EmbeddedField) [ Tag ] .
EmbeddedField = [ "*" ] TypeName .
Tag           = string_lit .
// An empty struct.
struct {}

// A struct with 6 fields.
struct {
 x, y int
 u float32
 _ float32  // padding
 A *[]int
 F func()
}
```

A field declared with a type but no explicit field name is called an *embedded field*. An embedded field must be specified as a type name `T` or as a pointer to a non-interface type name `*T`, and `T` itself may not be a pointer type. The unqualified type name acts as the field name.

```go
// A struct with four embedded fields of types T1, *T2, P.T3 and *P.T4
struct {
	T1        // field name is T1
	*T2       // field name is T2
	P.T3      // field name is T3
	*P.T4     // field name is T4
	x, y int  // field names are x and y
}
```

The following declaration is illegal because field names must be unique in a struct type:

```go
struct {
	T     // conflicts with embedded field *T and *P.T
	*T    // conflicts with embedded field T and *P.T
	*P.T  // conflicts with embedded field T and *T
}
```

A field or [method](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Method_declarations) `f` of an embedded field in a struct `x` is called *promoted* if `x.f` is a legal [selector](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Selectors) that denotes that field or method `f`.

Promoted fields act like ordinary fields of a struct except that they cannot be used as field names in [composite literals](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Composite_literals) of the struct.

Given a struct type `S` and a [defined type](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_definitions) `T`, promoted methods are included in the method set of the struct as follows:

- If `S` contains an embedded field `T`, the [method sets](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Method_sets) of `S` and `*S` both include promoted methods with receiver `T`. The method set of `*S` also includes promoted methods with receiver `*T`.
- If `S` contains an embedded field `*T`, the method sets of `S` and `*S` both include promoted methods with receiver `T` or `*T`.

A field declaration may be followed by an optional string literal *tag*, which becomes an attribute for all the fields in the corresponding field declaration. An empty tag string is equivalent to an absent tag. The tags are made visible through a [reflection interface](https://golang.google.cn/pkg/reflect/#StructTag) and take part in [type identity](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_identity) for structs but are otherwise ignored.

```go
struct {
	x, y float64 ""  // an empty tag string is like an absent tag
	name string  "any string is permitted as a tag"
	_    [4]byte "ceci n'est pas un champ de structure"
}

// A struct corresponding to a TimeStamp protocol buffer.
// The tag strings define the protocol buffer field numbers;
// they follow the convention outlined by the reflect package.
struct {
	microsec  uint64 `protobuf:"1"`
	serverIP6 uint64 `protobuf:"2"`
}
```

### 2.8.指针类型-数据类型



A pointer type denotes the set of all pointers to [variables](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Variables) of a given type, called the *base type* of the pointer. The value of an uninitialized pointer is `nil`.

```go
PointerType = "*" BaseType .
BaseType    = Type .
*Point
*[4]int
```

### 2.9.函数类型-数据类型



A function type denotes the set of all functions with the same parameter and result types. The value of an uninitialized variable of function type is `nil`.

```
FunctionType   = "func" Signature .
Signature      = Parameters [ Result ] .
Result         = Parameters | Type .
Parameters     = "(" [ ParameterList [ "," ] ] ")" .
ParameterList  = ParameterDecl { "," ParameterDecl } .
ParameterDecl  = [ IdentifierList ] [ "..." ] Type .
```

Within a list of parameters or results, the names (IdentifierList) must either all be present or all be absent. If present, each name stands for one item (parameter or result) of the specified type and all non-[blank](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Blank_identifier) names in the signature must be [unique](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Uniqueness_of_identifiers). If absent, each type stands for one item of that type. Parameter and result lists are always parenthesized except that if there is exactly one unnamed result it may be written as an unparenthesized type.

The final incoming parameter in a function signature may have a type prefixed with `...`. A function with such a parameter is called *variadic* and may be invoked with zero or more arguments for that parameter.

```go
func()
func(x int) int
func(a, _ int, z float32) bool
func(a, b int, z float32) (bool)
func(prefix string, values ...int)
func(a, b int, z float64, opt ...interface{}) (success bool)
func(int, int, float64) (float64, *[]int)
func(n int) func(p *T)
```

### 2.10.接口类型-数据类型



An interface type specifies a [method set](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Method_sets) called its *interface*. A variable of interface type can store a value of any type with a method set that is any superset of the interface. Such a type is said to *implement the interface*. The value of an uninitialized variable of interface type is `nil`.

```go
InterfaceType      = "interface" "{" { MethodSpec ";" } "}" .
MethodSpec         = MethodName Signature | InterfaceTypeName .
MethodName         = identifier .
InterfaceTypeName  = TypeName .
```

As with all method sets, in an interface type, each method must have a [unique](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Uniqueness_of_identifiers) non-[blank](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Blank_identifier) name.

```go
// A simple File interface.
interface {
	Read([]byte) (int, error)
	Write([]byte) (int, error)
	Close() error
}
interface {
	String() string
	String() string  // illegal: String not unique
	_(x int)         // illegal: method must have non-blank name
}
```

More than one type may implement an interface. For instance, if two types `S1` and `S2` have the method set

```go
func (p T) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)   { return … }
func (p T) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)  { return … }
func (p T) Close() error                       { return … }
```

(where `T` stands for either `S1` or `S2`) then the `File` interface is implemented by both `S1` and `S2`, regardless of what other methods `S1` and `S2` may have or share.

A type implements any interface comprising any subset of its methods and may therefore implement several distinct interfaces. For instance, all types implement the *empty interface*:

```go
interface{}
```

Similarly, consider this interface specification, which appears within a [type declaration](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_declarations) to define an interface called `Locker`:

```go
type Locker interface {
	Lock()
	Unlock()
}
```

If `S1` and `S2` also implement

```
func (p T) Lock() { … }
func (p T) Unlock() { … }
```

they implement the `Locker` interface as well as the `File` interface.

An interface `T` may use a (possibly qualified) interface type name `E` in place of a method specification. This is called *embedding* interface `E` in `T`; it adds all (exported and non-exported) methods of `E` to the interface `T`.

```go
type ReadWriter interface {
	Read(b Buffer) bool
	Write(b Buffer) bool
}

type File interface {
	ReadWriter  // same as adding the methods of ReadWriter
	Locker      // same as adding the methods of Locker
	Close()
}

type LockedFile interface {
	Locker
	File        // illegal: Lock, Unlock not unique
	Lock()      // illegal: Lock not unique
}
```

An interface type `T` may not embed itself or any interface type that embeds `T`, recursively.

```
// illegal: Bad cannot embed itself
type Bad interface {
	Bad
}

// illegal: Bad1 cannot embed itself using Bad2
type Bad1 interface {
	Bad2
}
type Bad2 interface {
	Bad1
}
```

### 2.11.字典类型-数据类型



A map is an unordered group of elements of one type, called the element type, indexed by a set of unique *keys* of another type, called the key type. The value of an uninitialized map is `nil`.

```go
MapType     = "map" "[" KeyType "]" ElementType .
KeyType     = Type .
```

The [comparison operators](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Comparison_operators) `==` and `!=` must be fully defined for operands of the key type; thus the key type must not be a function, map, or slice. If the key type is an interface type, these comparison operators must be defined for the dynamic key values; failure will cause a [run-time panic](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Run_time_panics).

```go
map[string]int
map[*T]struct{ x, y float64 }
map[string]interface{}
```

The number of map elements is called its length. For a map `m`, it can be discovered using the built-in function [`len`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Length_and_capacity) and may change during execution. Elements may be added during execution using [assignments](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Assignments) and retrieved with [index expressions](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Index_expressions); they may be removed with the [`delete`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Deletion_of_map_elements) built-in function.

A new, empty map value is made using the built-in function [`make`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Making_slices_maps_and_channels), which takes the map type and an optional capacity hint as arguments:

```go
make(map[string]int)
make(map[string]int, 100)
```

The initial capacity does not bound its size: maps grow to accommodate the number of items stored in them, with the exception of `nil` maps. A `nil` map is equivalent to an empty map except that no elements may be added.

### 2.12.通道类型-数据类型

A channel provides a mechanism for [concurrently executing functions](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Go_statements) to communicate by [sending](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Send_statements) and [receiving](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Receive_operator) values of a specified element type. The value of an uninitialized channel is `nil`.

```go
ChannelType = ( "chan" | "chan" "<-" | "<-" "chan" ) ElementType .
```

The optional `<-` operator specifies the channel *direction*, *send* or *receive*. If no direction is given, the channel is *bidirectional*. A channel may be constrained only to send or only to receive by [assignment](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Assignments) or explicit [conversion](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Conversions).

```go
chan T          // can be used to send and receive values of type T
chan<- float64  // can only be used to send float64s
<-chan int      // can only be used to receive ints
```

The `<-` operator associates with the leftmost `chan` possible:

```go
chan<- chan int    // same as chan<- (chan int)
chan<- <-chan int  // same as chan<- (<-chan int)
<-chan <-chan int  // same as <-chan (<-chan int)
chan (<-chan int)
```

A new, initialized channel value can be made using the built-in function [`make`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Making_slices_maps_and_channels), which takes the channel type and an optional *capacity* as arguments:

```go
make(chan int, 100)
```

The capacity, in number of elements, sets the size of the buffer in the channel. If the capacity is zero or absent, the channel is unbuffered and communication succeeds only when both a sender and receiver are ready. Otherwise, the channel is buffered and communication succeeds without blocking if the buffer is not full (sends) or not empty (receives). A `nil` channel is never ready for communication.

A channel may be closed with the built-in function [`close`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Close). The multi-valued assignment form of the [receive operator](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Receive_operator) reports whether a received value was sent before the channel was closed.

A single channel may be used in [send statements](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Send_statements), [receive operations](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Receive_operator), and calls to the built-in functions [`cap`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Length_and_capacity) and [`len`](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Length_and_capacity) by any number of goroutines without further synchronization. Channels act as first-in-first-out queues. For example, if one goroutine sends values on a channel and a second goroutine receives them, the values are received in the order sent.
