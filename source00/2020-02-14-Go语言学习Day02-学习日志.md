## 1. 类型属性和类型的值（[Properties of types and values](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Properties_of_types_and_values)）

### 1.1 类型判定 [Type identity](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_identity)

Two types are either *identical* or *different*.

A [defined type](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_definitions) is always different from any other type. Otherwise, two types are identical if their [underlying](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Types) type literals are structurally equivalent; that is, they have the same literal structure and corresponding components have identical types. In detail:

- Two array types are identical if they have identical element types and the same array length.
- Two slice types are identical if they have identical element types.
- Two struct types are identical if they have the same sequence of fields, and if corresponding fields have the same names, and identical types, and identical tags. [Non-exported](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Exported_identifiers) field names from different packages are always different.
- Two pointer types are identical if they have identical base types.
- Two function types are identical if they have the same number of parameters and result values, corresponding parameter and result types are identical, and either both functions are variadic or neither is. Parameter and result names are not required to match.
- Two interface types are identical if they have the same set of methods with the same names and identical function types. [Non-exported](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Exported_identifiers) method names from different packages are always different. The order of the methods is irrelevant.
- Two map types are identical if they have identical key and element types.
- Two channel types are identical if they have identical element types and the same direction.

Given the declarations

```go
type (
	A0 = []string
	A1 = A0
	A2 = struct{ a, b int }
	A3 = int
	A4 = func(A3, float64) *A0
	A5 = func(x int, _ float64) *[]string
)

type (
	B0 A0
	B1 []string
	B2 struct{ a, b int }
	B3 struct{ a, c int }
	B4 func(int, float64) *B0
	B5 func(x int, y float64) *A1
)

type	C0 = B0
```

these types are identical:

```go
A0, A1, and []string
A2 and struct{ a, b int }
A3 and int
A4, func(int, float64) *[]string, and A5

B0 and C0
[]int and []int
struct{ a, b *T5 } and struct{ a, b *T5 }
func(x int, y float64) *[]string, func(int, float64) (result *[]string), and A5
```

`B0` and `B1` are different because they are new types created by distinct [type definitions](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_definitions); `func(int, float64) *B0` and `func(x int, y float64) *[]string` are different because `B0` is different from `[]string`.



### 1.2 分配 Assignability

A value `x` is *assignable* to a [variable](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Variables) of type `T` ("`x` is assignable to `T`") if one of the following conditions applies:

- `x`'s type is identical to `T`.
- `x`'s type `V` and `T` have identical [underlying types](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Types) and at least one of `V` or `T` is not a [defined](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_definitions) type.
- `T` is an interface type and `x` [implements](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Interface_types) `T`.
- `x` is a bidirectional channel value, `T` is a channel type, `x`'s type `V` and `T` have identical element types, and at least one of `V` or `T` is not a defined type.
- `x` is the predeclared identifier `nil` and `T` is a pointer, function, slice, map, channel, or interface type.
- `x` is an untyped [constant](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Constants) [representable](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Representability) by a value of type `T`.

### 1.3 自动类型匹配  Representability

A [constant](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Constants) `x` is *representable* by a value of type `T` if one of the following conditions applies:

- `x` is in the set of values [determined](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Types) by `T`.
- `T` is a floating-point type and `x` can be rounded to `T`'s precision without overflow. Rounding uses IEEE 754 round-to-even rules but with an IEEE negative zero further simplified to an unsigned zero. Note that constant values never result in an IEEE negative zero, NaN, or infinity.
- `T` is a complex type, and `x`'s [components](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Complex_numbers) `real(x)` and `imag(x)` are representable by values of `T`'s component type (`float32` or `float64`).

```go
x                   T           x is representable by a value of T because

'a'                 byte        97 is in the set of byte values
97                  rune        rune is an alias for int32, and 97 is in the set of 32-bit integers
"foo"               string      "foo" is in the set of string values
1024                int16       1024 is in the set of 16-bit integers
42.0                byte        42 is in the set of unsigned 8-bit integers
1e10                uint64      10000000000 is in the set of unsigned 64-bit integers
2.718281828459045   float32     2.718281828459045 rounds to 2.7182817 which is in the set of float32 values
-1e-1000            float64     -1e-1000 rounds to IEEE -0.0 which is further simplified to 0.0
0i                  int         0 is an integer value
(42 + 0i)           float32     42.0 (with zero imaginary part) is in the set of float32 values
x                   T           x is not representable by a value of T because

0                   bool        0 is not in the set of boolean values
'a'                 string      'a' is a rune, it is not in the set of string values
1024                byte        1024 is not in the set of unsigned 8-bit integers
-1                  uint16      -1 is not in the set of unsigned 16-bit integers
1.1                 int         1.1 is not an integer value
42i                 float32     (0 + 42i) is not in the set of float32 values
1e1000              float64     1e1000 overflows to IEEE +Inf after rounding
```

## 2. 代码块 Blocks

A *block* is a possibly empty sequence of declarations and statements within matching brace brackets.

```
Block = "{" StatementList "}" .
StatementList = { Statement ";" } .
```

In addition to explicit blocks in the source code, there are implicit blocks:

1. The *universe block* encompasses all Go source text.
2. Each [package](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Packages) has a *package block* containing all Go source text for that package.
3. Each file has a *file block* containing all Go source text in that file.
4. Each ["if"](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#If_statements), ["for"](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#For_statements), and ["switch"](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Switch_statements) statement is considered to be in its own implicit block.
5. Each clause in a ["switch"](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Switch_statements) or ["select"](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Select_statements) statement acts as an implicit block.

Blocks nest and influence [scoping](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Declarations_and_scope).

## 3. 声明和作用域 Declarations and scope

A *declaration* binds a non-[blank](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Blank_identifier) identifier to a [constant](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Constant_declarations), [type](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_declarations), [variable](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Variable_declarations), [function](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Function_declarations), [label](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Labeled_statements), or [package](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Import_declarations). Every identifier in a program must be declared. No identifier may be declared twice in the same block, and no identifier may be declared in both the file and package block.

The [blank identifier](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Blank_identifier) may be used like any other identifier in a declaration, but it does not introduce a binding and thus is not declared. In the package block, the identifier `init` may only be used for [`init` function](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Package_initialization) declarations, and like the blank identifier it does not introduce a new binding.

```
Declaration   = ConstDecl | TypeDecl | VarDecl .
TopLevelDecl  = Declaration | FunctionDecl | MethodDecl .
```

The *scope* of a declared identifier is the extent of source text in which the identifier denotes the specified constant, type, variable, function, label, or package.

Go is lexically scoped using [blocks](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Blocks):

1. The scope of a [predeclared identifier](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Predeclared_identifiers) is the universe block.
2. The scope of an identifier denoting a constant, type, variable, or function (but not method) declared at top level (outside any function) is the package block.
3. The scope of the package name of an imported package is the file block of the file containing the import declaration.
4. The scope of an identifier denoting a method receiver, function parameter, or result variable is the function body.
5. The scope of a constant or variable identifier declared inside a function begins at the end of the ConstSpec or VarSpec (ShortVarDecl for short variable declarations) and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.
6. The scope of a type identifier declared inside a function begins at the identifier in the TypeSpec and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.

An identifier declared in a block may be redeclared in an inner block. While the identifier of the inner declaration is in scope, it denotes the entity declared by the inner declaration.

The [package clause](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Package_clause) is not a declaration; the package name does not appear in any scope. Its purpose is to identify the files belonging to the same [package](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Packages) and to specify the default package name for import declarations.

### 3.1 标签作用域 Label scopes

Labels are declared by [labeled statements](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Labeled_statements) and are used in the ["break"](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Break_statements), ["continue"](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Continue_statements), and ["goto"](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Goto_statements) statements. It is illegal to define a label that is never used. In contrast to other identifiers, labels are not block scoped and do not conflict with identifiers that are not labels. The scope of a label is the body of the function in which it is declared and excludes the body of any nested function.

### 3.2 空标识符 Blank identifier

The *blank identifier* is represented by the underscore character `_`. It serves as an anonymous placeholder instead of a regular (non-blank) identifier and has special meaning in [declarations](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Declarations_and_scope), as an [operand](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Operands), and in [assignments](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Assignments).

### 3.3 预定义标识符 Predeclared identifiers

The following identifiers are implicitly declared in the [universe block](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Blocks):

```
Types:
	bool byte complex64 complex128 error float32 float64
	int int8 int16 int32 int64 rune string
	uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

Constants:
	true false iota

Zero value:
	nil

Functions:
	append cap close complex copy delete imag len
	make new panic print println real recover
```

### 3.4 导出的标识符 Exported identifiers

An identifier may be *exported* to permit access to it from another package. An identifier is exported if both:

1. the first character of the identifier's name is a Unicode upper case letter (Unicode class "Lu"); and
2. the identifier is declared in the [package block](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Blocks) or it is a [field name](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Struct_types) or [method name](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#MethodName).

All other identifiers are not exported.

### 3.5 区分不同的标识符 Uniqueness of identifiers

Given a set of identifiers, an identifier is called *unique* if it is *different* from every other in the set. Two identifiers are different if they are spelled differently, or if they appear in different [packages](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Packages) and are not [exported](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Exported_identifiers). Otherwise, they are the same.

### 3.6 常量声明 Constant declarations

A constant declaration binds a list of identifiers (the names of the constants) to the values of a list of [constant expressions](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Constant_expressions). The number of identifiers must be equal to the number of expressions, and the *n*th identifier on the left is bound to the value of the *n*th expression on the right.

```
ConstDecl      = "const" ( ConstSpec | "(" { ConstSpec ";" } ")" ) .
ConstSpec      = IdentifierList [ [ Type ] "=" ExpressionList ] .

IdentifierList = identifier { "," identifier } .
ExpressionList = Expression { "," Expression } .
```

If the type is present, all constants take the type specified, and the expressions must be [assignable](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Assignability) to that type. If the type is omitted, the constants take the individual types of the corresponding expressions. If the expression values are untyped [constants](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Constants), the declared constants remain untyped and the constant identifiers denote the constant values. For instance, if the expression is a floating-point literal, the constant identifier denotes a floating-point constant, even if the literal's fractional part is zero.

```
const Pi float64 = 3.14159265358979323846
const zero = 0.0         // untyped floating-point constant
const (
	size int64 = 1024
	eof        = -1  // untyped integer constant
)
const a, b, c = 3, 4, "foo"  // a = 3, b = 4, c = "foo", untyped integer and string constants
const u, v float32 = 0, 3    // u = 0.0, v = 3.0
```

Within a parenthesized `const` declaration list the expression list may be omitted from any but the first ConstSpec. Such an empty list is equivalent to the textual substitution of the first preceding non-empty expression list and its type if any. Omitting the list of expressions is therefore equivalent to repeating the previous list. The number of identifiers must be equal to the number of expressions in the previous list. Together with the [`iota` constant generator](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Iota) this mechanism permits light-weight declaration of sequential values:

```
const (
	Sunday = iota
	Monday
	Tuesday
	Wednesday
	Thursday
	Friday
	Partyday
	numberOfDays  // this constant is not exported
)
```

### Iota

Within a [constant declaration](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Constant_declarations), the predeclared identifier `iota` represents successive untyped integer [constants](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Constants). Its value is the index of the respective [ConstSpec](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#ConstSpec) in that constant declaration, starting at zero. It can be used to construct a set of related constants:

```
const (
	c0 = iota  // c0 == 0
	c1 = iota  // c1 == 1
	c2 = iota  // c2 == 2
)

const (
	a = 1 << iota  // a == 1  (iota == 0)
	b = 1 << iota  // b == 2  (iota == 1)
	c = 3          // c == 3  (iota == 2, unused)
	d = 1 << iota  // d == 8  (iota == 3)
)

const (
	u         = iota * 42  // u == 0     (untyped integer constant)
	v float64 = iota * 42  // v == 42.0  (float64 constant)
	w         = iota * 42  // w == 84    (untyped integer constant)
)

const x = iota  // x == 0
const y = iota  // y == 0
```

By definition, multiple uses of `iota` in the same ConstSpec all have the same value:

```
const (
	bit0, mask0 = 1 << iota, 1<<iota - 1  // bit0 == 1, mask0 == 0  (iota == 0)
	bit1, mask1                           // bit1 == 2, mask1 == 1  (iota == 1)
	_, _                                  //                        (iota == 2, unused)
	bit3, mask3                           // bit3 == 8, mask3 == 7  (iota == 3)
)
```

This last example exploits the [implicit repetition](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Constant_declarations) of the last non-empty expression list.

### Type declarations

A type declaration binds an identifier, the *type name*, to a [type](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Types). Type declarations come in two forms: alias declarations and type definitions.



```
TypeDecl = "type" ( TypeSpec | "(" { TypeSpec ";" } ")" ) .
TypeSpec = AliasDecl | TypeDef .
```

#### Alias declarations

An alias declaration binds an identifier to the given type.

```
AliasDecl = identifier "=" Type .
```

Within the [scope](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Declarations_and_scope) of the identifier, it serves as an *alias* for the type.

```
type (
	nodeList = []*Node  // nodeList and []*Node are identical types
	Polar    = polar    // Polar and polar denote identical types
)
```

#### Type definitions

A type definition creates a new, distinct type with the same [underlying type](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Types) and operations as the given type, and binds an identifier to it.

```
TypeDef = identifier Type .
```

The new type is called a *defined type*. It is [different](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_identity) from any other type, including the type it is created from.

```
type (
	Point struct{ x, y float64 }  // Point and struct{ x, y float64 } are different types
	polar Point                   // polar and Point denote different types
)

type TreeNode struct {
	left, right *TreeNode
	value *Comparable
}

type Block interface {
	BlockSize() int
	Encrypt(src, dst []byte)
	Decrypt(src, dst []byte)
}
```

A defined type may have [methods](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Method_declarations) associated with it. It does not inherit any methods bound to the given type, but the [method set](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Method_sets) of an interface type or of elements of a composite type remains unchanged:

```
// A Mutex is a data type with two methods, Lock and Unlock.
type Mutex struct         { /* Mutex fields */ }
func (m *Mutex) Lock()    { /* Lock implementation */ }
func (m *Mutex) Unlock()  { /* Unlock implementation */ }

// NewMutex has the same composition as Mutex but its method set is empty.
type NewMutex Mutex

// The method set of PtrMutex's underlying type *Mutex remains unchanged,
// but the method set of PtrMutex is empty.
type PtrMutex *Mutex

// The method set of *PrintableMutex contains the methods
// Lock and Unlock bound to its embedded field Mutex.
type PrintableMutex struct {
	Mutex
}

// MyBlock is an interface type that has the same method set as Block.
type MyBlock Block
```

Type definitions may be used to define different boolean, numeric, or string types and associate methods with them:

```
type TimeZone int

const (
	EST TimeZone = -(5 + iota)
	CST
	MST
	PST
)

func (tz TimeZone) String() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("GMT%+dh", tz)
}
```

### Variable declarations

A variable declaration creates one or more [variables](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Variables), binds corresponding identifiers to them, and gives each a type and an initial value.

```
VarDecl     = "var" ( VarSpec | "(" { VarSpec ";" } ")" ) .
VarSpec     = IdentifierList ( Type [ "=" ExpressionList ] | "=" ExpressionList ) .
var i int
var U, V, W float64
var k = 0
var x, y float32 = -1, -2
var (
	i       int
	u, v, s = 2.0, 3.0, "bar"
)
var re, im = complexSqrt(-1)
var _, found = entries[name]  // map lookup; only interested in "found"
```

If a list of expressions is given, the variables are initialized with the expressions following the rules for [assignments](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Assignments). Otherwise, each variable is initialized to its [zero value](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#The_zero_value).

If a type is present, each variable is given that type. Otherwise, each variable is given the type of the corresponding initialization value in the assignment. If that value is an untyped constant, it is first implicitly [converted](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Conversions) to its [default type](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Constants); if it is an untyped boolean value, it is first implicitly converted to type `bool`. The predeclared value `nil` cannot be used to initialize a variable with no explicit type.

```
var d = math.Sin(0.5)  // d is float64
var i = 42             // i is int
var t, ok = x.(T)      // t is T, ok is bool
var n = nil            // illegal
```

Implementation restriction: A compiler may make it illegal to declare a variable inside a [function body](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Function_declarations) if the variable is never used.

### Short variable declarations

A *short variable declaration* uses the syntax:

```
ShortVarDecl = IdentifierList ":=" ExpressionList .
```

It is shorthand for a regular [variable declaration](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Variable_declarations) with initializer expressions but no types:

```
"var" IdentifierList = ExpressionList .
i, j := 0, 10
f := func() int { return 7 }
ch := make(chan int)
r, w, _ := os.Pipe()  // os.Pipe() returns a connected pair of Files and an error, if any
_, y, _ := coord(p)   // coord() returns three values; only interested in y coordinate
```

Unlike regular variable declarations, a short variable declaration may *redeclare* variables provided they were originally declared earlier in the same block (or the parameter lists if the block is the function body) with the same type, and at least one of the non-[blank](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Blank_identifier) variables is new. As a consequence, redeclaration can only appear in a multi-variable short declaration. Redeclaration does not introduce a new variable; it just assigns a new value to the original.

```
field1, offset := nextField(str, 0)
field2, offset := nextField(str, offset)  // redeclares offset
a, a := 1, 2                              // illegal: double declaration of a or no new variable if a was declared elsewhere
```

Short variable declarations may appear only inside functions. In some contexts such as the initializers for ["if"](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#If_statements), ["for"](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#For_statements), or ["switch"](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Switch_statements) statements, they can be used to declare local temporary variables.

### Function declarations

A function declaration binds an identifier, the *function name*, to a function.

```
FunctionDecl = "func" FunctionName Signature [ FunctionBody ] .
FunctionName = identifier .
FunctionBody = Block .
```

If the function's [signature](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Function_types) declares result parameters, the function body's statement list must end in a [terminating statement](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Terminating_statements).

```
func IndexRune(s string, r rune) int {
	for i, c := range s {
		if c == r {
			return i
		}
	}
	// invalid: missing return statement
}
```

A function declaration may omit the body. Such a declaration provides the signature for a function implemented outside Go, such as an assembly routine.

```
func min(x int, y int) int {
	if x < y {
		return x
	}
	return y
}

func flushICache(begin, end uintptr)  // implemented externally
```

### Method declarations

A method is a [function](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Function_declarations) with a *receiver*. A method declaration binds an identifier, the *method name*, to a method, and associates the method with the receiver's *base type*.

```
MethodDecl = "func" Receiver MethodName Signature [ FunctionBody ] .
Receiver   = Parameters .
```

The receiver is specified via an extra parameter section preceding the method name. That parameter section must declare a single non-variadic parameter, the receiver. Its type must be a [defined](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Type_definitions) type `T` or a pointer to a defined type `T`. `T` is called the receiver *base type*. A receiver base type cannot be a pointer or interface type and it must be defined in the same package as the method. The method is said to be *bound* to its receiver base type and the method name is visible only within [selectors](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Selectors) for type `T` or `*T`.

A non-[blank](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Blank_identifier) receiver identifier must be [unique](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Uniqueness_of_identifiers) in the method signature. If the receiver's value is not referenced inside the body of the method, its identifier may be omitted in the declaration. The same applies in general to parameters of functions and methods.

For a base type, the non-blank names of methods bound to it must be unique. If the base type is a [struct type](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Struct_types), the non-blank method and field names must be distinct.

Given defined type `Point`, the declarations

```
func (p *Point) Length() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y)
}

func (p *Point) Scale(factor float64) {
	p.x *= factor
	p.y *= factor
}
```

bind the methods `Length` and `Scale`, with receiver type `*Point`, to the base type `Point`.

The type of a method is the type of a function with the receiver as first argument. For instance, the method `Scale` has type

```
func(p *Point, factor float64)
```

However, a function declared this way is not a method.
